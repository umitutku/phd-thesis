Symmetries, either intact or broken, have proved to be at the heart
of how matter interacts. The Standard Model of fundamental interactions
(SM) is composed of three independent continuous symmetry groups denoted
$\SUgroup{3} \times \SUgroup{2} \times \Ugroup{1}$, representing the
strong force, weak isospin and hypercharge
respectively~
