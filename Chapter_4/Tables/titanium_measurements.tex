\caption{Radon emanation results as obtained from the UCL system for the titanium welded block and titanium sheet assays. The results do not take into account the cross-calibration systematic of the UCL detector. For comparison, details radon emanation results of stainless steel welding and foil are provided, as measured by the GERDA collaboration \cite{osti_20719228, ZUZEL2009889}.}
